In this project we'll be the Dr. Jillian Bellovary, a real-life astronomer for the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. As an astronomer, part of our job is to study the stars. We've recently become interested in the constellation Orion, a collection of stars that appear in our night sky and form the shape of [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)), a warrior God from ancient Greek mythology. 

As a researcher on the Hayden Planetarium team, we are in charge of visualizing the Orion constellation in 3D using the Matplotlib function `.scatter()`. To learn more about the `.scatter()` we can see the Matplotlib documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html). 

We will create a rotate-able visualization of the position of the Orion's stars and get a better sense of their actual positions. To achieve this, we will be mapping real data from outer space that maps the position of the stars in the sky

The goal of the project is to understand spatial perspective. Once we visualize Orion in both 2D and 3D, we will be able to see the difference in the constellation shape humans see from earth versus the actual position of the stars that make up this constellation.
